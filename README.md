Anywaa-English dictionary

Work-in-progress for a dha-Anywaa-English dictionary (dha-Anywaa is a threatened language in western Ethiopia and South Sudan).
Future fixes
- fix sorting to accommodate the dha-Anywaa alphabet (which contains non-English characters)
- continue populating array with new terms (we are crowd-sourcing this dictionary from Facebook!)
- add divs and headers for each letter/letter group as the dictionary expands
